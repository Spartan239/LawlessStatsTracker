# LawlessStatsTracker
SA:MP Statistics for Lawless Roleplay


This Java applet is designed to implement SA-MP query features and retrieve information from the SA-MP roleplay server, Lawless Roleplay. <br>
It can be used as an example of implementing query mechanics for SA-MP into a Java environment.

<br>
Want to view the applet? You will need to do the following:<br>
Java Update 8u20:<br>
* You will need to add Spartan239.github.io/LawlessStatsTracker to your exclusions list<br>
See http://java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml for more information.<br>
<br>
Earlier version than 8u20:<br>
You can either:<br>
* Add Spartan239.github.io/LawlessStatsTracker to your exclusions list<br>
* Lower security level to 'Medium' and approve the applet running when prompted (not recommended)<br>
Please see http://java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml for more information.<br>
Once you have added the website to exclusions, visit Spartan239.github.io/LawlessStatsTracker (and don't forget to allow Java plugin on the page if it prompts!)<br>

Why is this the case?<br>
For security reasons, Java has always had restrictions on applets. I cannot work around this without paying a lot of money to get a certificate, which is both pointless (as this is not a commercial product or will be used frequently) and money consuming on a relatively frequent basis (generally between payments annually or bi-annually). <br>
