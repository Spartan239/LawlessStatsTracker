# LawlessStatsTracker
SA:MP Statistics for Lawless Roleplay


This Java applet is designed to implement SA-MP query features and retrieve information from the SA-MP roleplay server, Lawless Roleplay. 
It can be used as an example of implementing query mechanics for SA-MP into a Java environment.

Want to view the applet? You will need to do the following:
Java Update 8u20:
* You will need to add Spartan239.github.io/LawlessStatsTracker to your exclusions list
See http://java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml for more information.

Earlier version than 8u20:
You can either:
* Add Spartan239.github.io/LawlessStatsTracker to your exclusions list
* Lower security level to 'Medium' and approve the applet running when prompted (not recommended)
Please see http://java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml for more information.
#
Once you have added the website to exclusions, visit Spartan239.github.io/LawlessStatsTracker (and don't forget to allow Java plugin on the page if it prompts!)

Why is this the case?
For security reasons, Java has always had restrictions on applets. I cannot work around this without paying a lot of money to get a certificate, which is both pointless (as this is not a commercial product or will be used frequently) and money consuming on a relatively frequent basis (generally between payments annually or bi-annually).
